//Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles.
//One driver has kept track of several trips by recording miles driven 
//and gallons used for each trip. Devel- op a C++ program that uses a 
//while statement to input the miles driven and gallons used for each trip. 
//The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for 
//each trip and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls
//up to this point.
